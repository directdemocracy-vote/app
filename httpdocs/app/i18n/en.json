The principle is that people will become citizens by proposing referundums and voting regardless of any official acknowledgement. Vote results from a limited number of citizens could be considered as simple survey results. They could feed debates, influence political decisions and foster more people to become citizens. Vote results from areas where a majority of people are citizens will become significant from a democratic point of view. This will increase the pressure on governments to respect the democratic choices expressed by their people. Ultimately, this bottom-up initiative will enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.",
